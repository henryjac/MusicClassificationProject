We will do some preprocessing of the data we get since not all of the features will be correlated to the labels.

One way to do preprocessing is to check the correlation between the features (TODO: Add math formula for this), which we
have done using pandas, and then plotted using seaborn. 

Here we can see that \texttt{dancability} and \texttt{valence} are not very correlated with the labels, so we will disregard them. 
It is also clear that \texttt{instrumentalness} and \texttt{acousticness} is very correlated with eachother, so we will disregard one of
them, since they both would give the same information.
